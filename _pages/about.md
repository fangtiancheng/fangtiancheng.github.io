I am currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), supervised by [Prof. Chaoyue Niu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=485) and [Prof. Fan Wu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from SJTU, 2023.
